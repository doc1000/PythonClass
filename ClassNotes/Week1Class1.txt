UX - user experience

automation of tasks using the command line


why pythong vs R - integrated part of data flow, general purpose programming language - can do way more without leaving the python environment -  maybe less i/o or handoff


why linux vs windows
saying that windows tends to focus on closed systems, while Linux (yes) and macOS(?) are a bit more wide open

- most importantly the broader class ONLY lets you use macOS and linux.  so maybe go get a linux box.


Excel - doesn't integrate as well - more visual

they like unix based because the code tends to be more open source which leads to faster devp

remember on unix - case sensitive
	/ is the file sepe
s
	.exe - text after the dot gives a hint what program does and how to run it

relative path is always relative to the current working directory - works down from below
absolute pathname is from the rootfile of the system - begins with the slash - solid but if run on a diff computer paths may not be the same

GIT - pretty much just an alternative to command prompt for unix

Navi:
pwd	present working dir
cd	change dir 	
ls	lists files

creating and removing 
mkdir	make a directory
rmdir	remove a directory
rm -r	remove a file, remvoes files recursively, whether empty or not

creating adn removing
touch - creates an empty file or updates the access time on existing file
rm	thsi removes a file - does not create any backup

copy
cp	copy a file
mv	moving a file, or move to a new name
cp -r	copies everything recursively, meaning everything in subdirectories

clear 	clears screen and pushes to the top

you can use ..  and ../.. to go previous direcdtories, either to cd or ls

cntl a and ctrl e moves back and front in bash

you can paginate the ls results using the | less ("pipe less") - otherwise called "less"
to escape you have to hit "q" as in quit
you can hit "g" to go up
"/py" to look for py


this is what pipe does:
 std In ---> PROCESS  --> stdoutput (cmd prompt)
		      --> stdErr 

into to GIT:
essentially just a distributed version control system
there will be local GIT that will track changes locally on specific files




make sure you are committing changes so that what "worked" is saved and you don't make multiple changes

two ways to make a git is to 'init' from bash and its also and most likely going to be cloned from github

git init in bash
ls .git/ to see files.  don't mess with them

launch atom: "atom ."

git commit
git add filename

remote repositories live in teh clud and enable synchronizing

GitHub is a web service that provides remote repositories, others such as Bitbucket

two programmers with git: Alice and Bob


cline a local repository from remote repo - like enchance copy

make change and commit them

push tyour changes to remote

pull other people canges from the remote

need to figure out how to open atom directly from bash
i'm guessing I need to put it in a path file or something

use less to open a file in bash less 2015_data.csv

grep 'GOOG' 2015_data.csv | less
			  | sort


use --help or -? instead of 'man' (manual)

grep 'GOOG' 2015_data.csv | sort > 2015_data_sorted.csv


I have VI editor as default - not sure alternative, need to escape commit screen by hitting esc + :wq
